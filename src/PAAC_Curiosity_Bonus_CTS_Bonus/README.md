This code has been adapted from https://github.com/Alfredvc/paac (the original authors' code).
We made the following changes to it :-

1. We added the curiosity network(ICM).
2. We added the VizDoom environment ( the original code had the Atari 2600 ALE.)
3. To run the code, you will need to install all the packages in the requirements.txt file.
